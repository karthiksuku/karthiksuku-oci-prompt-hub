# OCI Prompt Engine

A **complete**, community-first prompt library and docs site â€” inspired by  **real, ready-to-use prompts**, runnable examples, a **local Playground**, and **OCI Generative AI** integration paths.

- 1000+ curated prompts in a machine-readable **registry** (`/prompts/registry/*.json`)
- Auto-generated prompt docs at build time
- **Examples**: Node & Python clients for OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and **OCI** endpoints
- **Evaluation** scripts (simple A/B) and a shared test-set
- **Cookbook** projects (Email drafter, SQL helper, RAG starter) with runnable code
- **Local search** and **i18n (en/ko)** support
- One-click **GitHub Pages** deployment (Actions included)

> Replace `karthiksuku` and `karthiksuku` in `docusaurus.config.ts` before deployment.
