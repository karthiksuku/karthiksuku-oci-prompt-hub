Given a prompt and two outputs, select the better one with a brief rubric-based rationale.
```

## Usage (OpenAI-compatible)
```bash
curl -s $OPENAI_BASE_URL/chat/completions \\
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \\
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
 -d '{
   "model":"$OPENAI_MODEL",
   "messages":[
     {"role":"system","content":"Given a prompt and two outputs, select the better one with a brief rubric-based rationale."},
     {"role":"user","content":"<your input here>"}
   ]
 }'
```

- See **/examples** for client code.
